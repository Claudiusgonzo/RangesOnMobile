# RangesOnMobile: Supplemental Videos

This folder contains mobile screen capture videos of two experimental sessions (one with Temperature data and a second with Sleep data); the videos were recorded using an iPhone 5s running the Chrome mobile browser, with iOS accessibility controls toggled to show the touch point.
